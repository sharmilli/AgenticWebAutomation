#### **Agentic Browser Automation Design Document**

---

### **1. Problem Statement**
Manually filling out forms and interacting with web-based interfaces is time-consuming and error-prone. Current automation tools often lack adaptability, requiring significant configuration for specific tasks. The goal is to create an agentic AI-powered browser script that can dynamically:
- Extract HTML form elements.
- Leverage recommendations from an LLM or user data repository.
- Automate form filling and submission.

---

### **2. Proposed Solution**
The proposed solution is a lightweight JavaScript automation tool that:
1. Extracts the DOM structure of a webpageâ€™s form fields.
2. Fetches intelligent recommendations for form values based on user context.
3. Programmatically fills and submits the form, enabling seamless automation.

---

### **3. Architecture Overview**

#### **Key Components**
- **DOM Scanner**: Extracts form elements from the webpage and structures them into JSON.
- **Recommendation Fetcher**: Sends the extracted DOM JSON to a backend API and retrieves recommendations.
- **Form Filler**: Maps the recommendations to corresponding fields on the form and submits it.
